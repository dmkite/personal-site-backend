        "desc":"The Kidogo Mobile App was designed for folks with Kenyan women in their 20's to 50's with limited literacy - because of this iconography and the UI needed to be instantly understandable. This posed a significant challenge as we were separated by language and culture; what they readily recognized would be lost in my context. Extensive research and vetting went in to the design work, which ended up being a mix of English, Swahili, iconography, and audio cues.",
