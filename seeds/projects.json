      "Description": "As the sole developer I owned discovery work with users & stakeholders, designed, developed, and delivered the Kidogo Mobile App prototype; a childcare Swiss army knife. The app offers digital and automated solutions for enrollment, payments, attendance, and finance tracking.",
      "Architecture": "Limited funds and rapidly growing clientele necessitated an affordable, scalable solution. The Kidogo app is a serverless, offline-first React Native app. When users have access to wifi they send data via HTTP request, triggering a Node/Express Lambda, and persisting data through DynamoDB ensuring Kidogo only pays for what it uses.",
      "Impact": "The prototype is currently being user tested by 30 participants across multiple childcare centers in Kenya. Development continues after the rigorous onboarding I provided to new freelance developers to support continuous integration and development."
